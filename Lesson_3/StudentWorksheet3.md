## AI Lesson 3: Picky Eater ##

Does your puppy love brown biscuits but refuse to eat pink treats? Train your SPIKE Puppy to recognize many different shades of colors beyond simple LEGO bricks and use it to customize your puppy’s reactions to various food sources.

**Design Brief:**

You may choose to design and build your own robotic pet using your SPIKE kit, and feel free to reference the placemat for inspiration! Your puppy should be able to react in at least two different ways to indicate that it has successfully identified a certain color of “food”.

Teach your puppy to recognize any shade of a certain color by training it with real-world objects that have many variations on that color. Training is accomplished by following the prompts printed out on the REPL, and holding an object in front of the puppy’s “mouth” for several seconds, assigning it to a particular category - in this case, a color. Use many different examples for each color category - the more examples, the better your puppy will learn! After training the puppy for a few color categories, program your puppy to react accordingly when it sees any variation on one of the colors it has been trained for.

**Think about these questions:**
* How can you ensure the use of a wide variety of hues of the same color when training? What objects will you use and why?
* What reactions do you want the puppy to have, and how will you code for that? Does it get happy when it sees orange things and sad when it sees purple things?
* Is this an example of supervised or unsupervised learning?

**Hints:** 

* When training for a specific color, make sure you use many different hues of that color. For example, if you are training for the color blue, be sure to use dark and pale blues, greenish and purplish blues, and a variety of surfaces like smooth, shiny, matte, rough, fuzzy, soft, etc. 
* When training for a specific color, move the observed object around during the 5 second session so that your puppy can view it from many angles and distances. As the distances and angles of light hitting the surface of the object change, it will produce different variations of color to observe. 

Your puppy should be able to observe an object’s color and correctly categorize it into one of your pre-trained color groups. When it has correctly categorized the color, it will produce an accompanying reaction. Train your puppy to recognize at least three different colors. 

Work with your partner to document your initial ideas. Decide how you will evaluate these ideas to pick the best one(s) for your project. Share with another group or your teacher why you chose this solution.

Communicate the results of your group’s work by creating a presentation that demonstrates the functionality of your puppy and the code. 

Ask for feedback and conduct a self-assessment. Use the evaluation tools your teacher has provided.
