## AI Lesson 2: Pet the Puppy ##

Show your pet some love. Teach your SPIKE Puppy to notice the difference between exciting short pets and calming long strokes on its back.

**Design Brief:**

You may choose to design and build your own robotic pet using your SPIKE kit, and feel free to reference the placemat for inspiration! Make sure that your puppy is able to register long and short presses of the touch sensor. It must also be able to exhibit two distinct behaviors in reaction to the length of pats it receives.  

Program a robotic puppy that uses a touch sensor to receive user input. The puppy should “learn” the difference between pats (short) and strokes (long) and use this knowledge to classify incoming data as pats or strokes and respond accordingly.

The method used to accomplish this is K-Nearest Neighbor, which uses “supervised” training unlike methods like K-Means Clustering, which uses “unsupervised” training.

**Think about these questions:**
* What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning?
* How does the size of the training set affect your puppy’s ability to learn? How will you decide how large your training set will be?
* What reactions to short pets and long strokes should your puppy have? How will you code for these reactions?

**Hints:**

* When building your own original puppy design, make sure the touch sensor is in an accessible location for petting. 
* Consider adding something to the touch sensor to broaden the area of contact, making it easier to reach over and pet your puppy. 

Your design should be able to learn and recognize the difference between short pets and long strokes, using the supervised learning technique. Once you have trained your puppy with a data set, it should be able to continuously respond to a pet or stroke with a pre-determined reaction. 

Work with your partner to document your initial ideas. Decide how you will evaluate these ideas to pick the best one(s) for your project. Share with another group or your teacher why you chose this solution.

Communicate the results of your group’s work by creating a presentation that demonstrates the functionality of your puppy and the code. 

Ask for feedback and conduct a self-assessment. Use the evaluation tools your teacher has provided.
